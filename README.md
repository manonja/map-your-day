# map-your-day
An app to plan your day!

Project requirements
1. Must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a Rails API backend. All interactions between the client and the server should be handled asynchronously (AJAX).

2. Must render out a resource with at least one has-many relationship in the JSON.

3. Must use your Rails API and a form generated by the client to create a resource and render the response without a page refresh. 

4. No user authentication with passwords. When the page refreshes the current user will effectively be signed out.
