# map-your-day
An app to plan your day!

### Motivations
- Must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a Rails API backend. 
- All interactions between the client and the server are handled asynchronously (AJAX).
- Must render out a resource with at least one has-many relationship in the JSON.
- Must use your Rails API and a form generated by the client to create a resource and render the response without a page refresh. 
- No user authentication with passwords. When the page refreshes the current user will effectively be signed out. 

### Technical Details
- frontend built with HTML and vanilla JavaScript
- styling with pure CSS and MDBootstrap 
- backend built with Ruby on Rails with two endpoints (one for the users, one for the activities)
- use of serializer gem so we have a customised JSON
- use of Google maps API to select the location of the activity

### Getting started
